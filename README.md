🌤️ WeatherNow – Real-Time Weather Web App
WeatherNow is a sleek, responsive web application that provides users with real-time weather updates for any city in the world. Built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript, the app fetches live data from the WeatherAPI via RapidAPI, and displays temperature, humidity, and wind speed in a beautifully designed interface.
